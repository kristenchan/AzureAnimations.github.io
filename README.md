Above illustrates the process of provisioning Azure OpenAI, we start by using the Azure Portal. First, navigate to the Azure AI Foundry where you can select the appropriate model for your needs, such as GPT-4, GPT-4o, etc. Before users can consume the model, they need to select the model and create a deployment. There are several types of deployments available:

1. Azure Portal: Start by using the Azure Portal to navigate to Azure AI Foundry.
2. Select Model: Choose the right model (e.g., GPT-4, GPT-4o) 🧠.
3. Create Deployment:
   - Global-Batch: For offline scoring 🕒.
   - Global-Standard: Recommended starting point 🌍.
   - Global-Provisioned: For real-time scoring with high volume 📈.
   - Standard: General-purpose deployment.
   - Provisioned: For high-volume workloads.
   - Data Zone Standard: Leverages Azure global infrastructure for best availability and higher default quotas.
   - Data Zone Provisioned: Global infrastructure, best availability, reserved capacity for high and predictable throughput.
4. Deploy: Once deployed, the application calls the Azure OpenAI endpoint using the deployment ID 🔗, using the SDK REST API.

  </p>
</div>

Above illustrates the process of using Managed Identities, comparing the traditional old-school way of using shared credentials to the modern approach of managed identities in Azure, highlighting enhanced security and simplified access management

1. **Traditional Approach: Shared Secrets and Credentials 🔑**

   Using shared secrets or credentials to access Azure resources has several drawbacks:
   - **Security Risks**: Potential exposure and misuse. ⚠️
   - **Maintenance Overhead**: Regularly rotating secrets is cumbersome. 🔄
   - **Complexity**: Securely distributing secrets adds complexity. 🧩

2. **Modern Approach: Managed Identities in Azure 🌐**

   Managed identities provide a secure and streamlined way to access Azure resources without managing secrets.

3. **Key Benefits 🌟**

   1. **No Secret Management**: Reduces risk of exposure. 🚫🔑
   2. **Simplified Access Control**: Integrated with Azure Active Directory (AAD). 🔐
   3. **Automatic Credential Management**: Azure handles credential rotation. 🔄🔒
   4. **Enhanced Security**: Aligns with the principle of least privilege. 🛡️

4. **Example Use Case 💡**

   Azure AI Services need to access Azure Blob Storage:
   - Assigned a managed identity. 🆔
   - Granted access (RBAC) to the Blob Storage. 🔐
   - Authenticates and accesses data without managing credentials. 🔑

5. **Conclusion 📈**

   Adopting managed identities enhances security, reduces overhead, and simplifies access management. This approach aligns with best practices for secure application development in Azure.

### Managed Identities in Azure: Enhancing Security Part 2

  </p>
</div>

The animation on the left illustrates the use of system-assigned managed identities in various scenarios:

1. **Application Running in a VM** 🖥️
   - A system-assigned managed identity is created and tied to the VM.
   - This identity is used to securely access Azure resources like Azure Blob Storage.

2. **PaaS Compute Services** ☁️
   - PaaS compute services, such as Azure App Service or Azure Functions, each have their own system-assigned managed identity.
   - These identities are automatically managed by Azure and can be used to access other Azure resources securely.

3. **Document Intelligence** 📄
   - Document intelligence services also utilize system-assigned managed identities.
   - Each service has its own identity, ensuring secure and streamlined access to necessary resources.

The animation on the right illustrates the use of user-assigned managed identities:

4. **Shared Identity Across Multiple Resources** 🔄
   - A user-assigned managed identity can be created and assigned to multiple Azure resources.
   - This identity can be shared among different services, such as VMs, PaaS compute services, and Document Intelligence.

5. **Centralized Identity Management** 🛠️
   - User-assigned managed identities provide a centralized way to manage identities.
   - This approach simplifies the management of permissions and access controls across multiple resources.

6. **Flexible and Reusable** 🔄
   - User-assigned managed identities are flexible and can be reused across different resources.
   - This reduces the need to create multiple identities for different services, streamlining identity management.

7. **Key Points**

   - **Automatic Identity Management**: Each Azure resource (VM, PaaS compute, Document Intelligence) gets its own system-assigned managed identity.
   - **Secure Resource Access**: These identities can be used to connect to Azure Blob Storage without managing credentials.
   - **Isolation and Security**: Each identity is tied to a specific resource, enhancing security and isolation.

8. **Example Use Case** 💡

   - **Azure Blob Storage Access**:
      - The application in the VM, PaaS compute services, and Document Intelligence services each use their respective system-assigned managed identities.
      - These identities are granted the necessary permissions (RBAC) to access Azure Blob Storage.
      - This setup ensures secure and seamless access to storage without the need for managing secrets.

   - **Shared Identity for Multiple Resources**:
      - A user-assigned managed identity is created and assigned to the VM, PaaS compute services, and Document Intelligence services.
      - This shared identity is granted the necessary permissions (RBAC) to access Azure Blob Storage.
      - This approach simplifies identity management and provides a flexible way to manage access across multiple resources.

9. **Conclusion** 📈

   System-assigned managed identities simplify identity management and enhance security by providing each Azure resource with its own identity. User-assigned managed identities offer flexibility and centralized management by allowing a single identity to be shared across multiple resources. Both approaches align with best practices for secure application development in Azure.
