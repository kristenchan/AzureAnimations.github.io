5. **Centralized Identity Management** 🛠️
   - User-assigned managed identities provide a centralized way to manage identities.
   - This approach simplifies the management of permissions and access controls across multiple resources.

6. **Flexible and Reusable** 🔄
   - User-assigned managed identities are flexible and can be reused across different resources.
   - This reduces the need to create multiple identities for different services, streamlining identity management.

7. **Key Points**

   - **Automatic Identity Management**: Each Azure resource (VM, PaaS compute, Document Intelligence) gets its own system-assigned managed identity.
   - **Secure Resource Access**: These identities can be used to connect to Azure Blob Storage without managing credentials.
   - **Isolation and Security**: Each identity is tied to a specific resource, enhancing security and isolation.

8. **Example Use Case** 💡

   - **Azure Blob Storage Access**:
      - The application in the VM, PaaS compute services, and Document Intelligence services each use their respective system-assigned managed identities.
      - These identities are granted the necessary permissions (RBAC) to access Azure Blob Storage.
      - This setup ensures secure and seamless access to storage without the need for managing secrets.

   - **Shared Identity for Multiple Resources**:
      - A user-assigned managed identity is created and assigned to the VM, PaaS compute services, and Document Intelligence services.
      - This shared identity is granted the necessary permissions (RBAC) to access Azure Blob Storage.
      - This approach simplifies identity management and provides a flexible way to manage access across multiple resources.

9. **Conclusion** 📈

   System-assigned managed identities simplify identity management and enhance security by providing each Azure resource with its own identity. User-assigned managed identities offer flexibility and centralized management by allowing a single identity to be shared across multiple resources. Both approaches align with best practices for secure application development in Azure.
